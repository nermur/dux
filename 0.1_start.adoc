=== Cautionary tale about Windows dual-booting
[%collapsible]
====
Windows cannot be trusted; Windows 10 LTSC 2019 erased the partitions on my _previously_ ext4 formatted 4TB drive, and damaged that ext4 filesystem beyond repair.

NOTE: This drive was never mounted in Windows, and was not the primary disk; the primary disk had both Linux and Windows installed. +
It's 29 Nov 2021 and the same drive has seemingly no issues, being mainly a video archival drive as it was then; this damage caused by Windows happened in ~2019.
